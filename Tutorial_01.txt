<color=#00FF58>Use <b>W, A, S & D</b> in order to go to the <b>toilets</b>\nUse <b>E</b> to <b>interact</b> with doors and items.</color>
Great, now take it.
Keycards are one of the most basic elements of the game, allowing entrance to locked areas.\nCheck the nearby doors and try to open them with your card.
<color=#00FF58>Use <b>TAB</b> to open inventory.\n<b>Left mouse button</b> to select item\nand <b>right</b> to drop it.

Congratulations! You just passed the first part of the tutorial!
